Guacamole is an extendable and efficient rendering system for visualizing 
different data types. It features a lightweight scene graph and a modern
deferred shading system. Many common post processing effects are already
integrated, e.g. screen space ambient occlusion, HDR, FXAA, volumetric light
effects, bloom and fog.

Installation
------------

You need a NVIDIA GPU that supports OpenGL 4.2 and CUDA.

### Windows

We recommend building guacamole with Visual Studio 2013. We created a zip file
with all necessary dependencies.
Get `externals_vc120RC.zip` from https://github.com/vrsys/guacamole-externals.
Create a new directory `externals/` under the project root.
Unpack `externals_vc120RC.zip` into the `externals/` directory.
Then configure with `cmake` and build the library with Visual Studio.

### Linux
The following guide serves as a step-by-step tutorial on how to build the dependencies and guacamole itself on Linux. It was tested on a fresh installation of Ubuntu 16.04, and the latest commit at the point of writing was `1097eff`.

_Bullet_
  * clone https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3
  * configure with CMake and enable flag `INSTALL_EXTRA_LIBS`
  * `make install`
  * the Bullet include directory will be `/usr/local/include`
 
_Boost_
  * `apt-get install libboost-all-dev`
  * the Boost include directory will be `/usr/include/boost`
  * the Boost library directory will be `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu`
 
 _JSONCpp_
  * `apt-get install libjsoncpp-dev`
  * the JSONCpp library will be `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libjsoncpp.so`
  
_GLFW_
  * `apt-get install libglfw3-dev`
  * the GLFW include directory will be `/usr/include`
  * the GLFW library will be `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libglfw.so`

_ZMQ_
  * `apt-get install libzmq3-dev`
  * the ZMQ include directory will be `/usr/include`
  * the ZMQ library will be `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libzmq.so`
 
_FBX_
  * get FBX SDK from [Autodesk](http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/pc/item?siteID=123112&id=10775847)
  * unpack and execute install script in desired installation directory
  * when FBX is located in `FBX_PATH`, the FBX include directory will be `FBX_PATH/include`
  * when FBX is located in `FBX_PATH`, the FBX library directories will be `FBX_PATH/lib/gcc4/release` and `FBX_PATH/lib/gcc4/debug`
  
_Schism_
  * `apt-get install libfreetype6-dev libfreeimageplus-dev opencl-headers`
  * clone https://github.com/chrislu/schism
  * adapt find script `build/cmake/custom_scripts/schism_boost.cmake` such that `SCM_BOOST_INCLUDE_SEARCH_DIRS` is `/usr/include` and `SCM_BOOST_LIBRARY_SEARCH_DIRS` is `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu`
  * configure with CMake
  * `make install`
  * when Schism is located in `SCHISM_PATH`, the Schism inlcude directories will be `SCHISM_PATH/scm_cl_core/src;SCHISM_PATH/scm_core/src;SCHISM_PATH/scm_gl_core/src;SCHISM_PATH/scm_gl_util/src;SCHISM_PATH/scm_input/src`
  * when Schism is located in `SCHISM_PATH`, the Schism library directory will be `SCHISM_PATH/lib/linux_x86`
  
_Lamure_
  * `apt-get install freeglut3-dev libcgal-dev libglm-dev libxmu-dev`
  * clone https://github.com/vrsys/lamure
  * adapt find script `cmake/modules/find_schism.cmake` such that `SCHISM_INCLUDE_SEARCH_DIRS` and `SCHISM_LIBRARY_SEARCH_DIRS` contain the paths mentioned above
  * configure with CMake
  * `make install`
  * when Lamure is located in `LAMURE_PATH`, the Lamure include directory will be `LAMURE_PATH/install/include`
  * when Lamure is located in `LAMURE_PATH`, the Lamure library directory will be `LAMURE_PATH/install/lib`
  
_guacamole_
  * `apt-get install libassimp-dev`
  * clone https://github.com/vrsys/guacamole (this repository)
  * configure with CMake and set paths to dependencies as mentioned above if not found automatically
  * CMake flags that were set to ON during writing this tutorial: `GUACAMOLE_ENABLE_PHYSICS`, `GUACAMOLE_EXAMPLES`, `GUACAMOLE_FBX`, `GUACAMOLE_GLFW3`, `GUACAMOLE_RUNTIME_PROGRAM_COMP`, `PLUGIN_guacamole-lod`, `PLUGIN_guacamole-skelanim`, `PLUGIN_guacamole-tv_3`, `PLUGIN_guacamole-video3d`, `PLUGIN_guacamole-volume`
  * `make install`

If everything worked well, you can start by running an example in the `examples/` directory, e.g. the `input` example.
